## Minesweeper [WIP]

A Minesweeper clone coded in Python using the Pygame library. Supports three difficulties: beginner, intermediate, and expert; this reflects most of the options available in the original game. A testing file is included for the functions used in the game's code (WIP).

### Current state: not finished and code has not been cleaned up
